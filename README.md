Welcome to the [Genshin Rotation Optimiser](https://genshin-rotation.com/)! This app was designed and built by **@saurusness** and **@thisRaptori**, using
frame timing data from [gcsim](https://gcsim.app/), and general character data from the [Genshin Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Character).

This repo serves as an issue tracker for the app - if you encounter any problems, please create an issue here and we'll get to it ASAP!
